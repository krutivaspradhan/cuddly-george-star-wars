# Best Star Wars Movie Ranking

2024 v1.2

## The Problem

As a Star Wars enthusiast, I wanted to share my personal ranking of the Star Wars movies in a way that is accessible and visually appealing. The challenge was to create a website that is not only informative but also easy to navigate, responsive on all devices, and aesthetically pleasing. Additionally, I wanted to ensure that the navigation elements and footer behaved correctly across different screen sizes, with the footer always staying at the bottom of the page.


## Testing

Functional Testing:

Verify that the navigation bar links work and open in a new tab.
Check that the hamburger menu expands and collapses correctly on mobile devices.
Ensure the main content area lists the movies as intended.
Confirm that the footer remains at the bottom of the page regardless of the content height.

Usability Testing:

Test the site on different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) to ensure responsiveness.
